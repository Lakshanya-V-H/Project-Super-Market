                        <p>I have been using Best Grocery since 2020. Products are always delivered with care. Never had a problem. They even send some free biscuits etc. sometimes. I live in UK and always received the order the next working day. The website is very easy to use and there is a variety of products. Would recommend.

                        <p>Faultless service! I placed an online order on 31.1.23 and it was delivered to Scotland the next morning 1.2.23. I ordered ordered frozen and fresh items and they arrived with ice packs in the box so the food was kept at the correct temperature. I also received a free gift with my order which was an unexpected surprise. I will be placing an other order shortly. 10/10

                        <p>I was very happy that my orders were delivered perfectly. They also sent some extra food as gifts. Very polite and good manners. They covered every product that could leak or break with air sponges in a very durable way. For cold products, there was a special box with frosted bags. I can really say that they are very good at this. I also bought a few salad ingredients. Cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers etc... It was fresh.
